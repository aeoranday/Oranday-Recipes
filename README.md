### Oranday Recipe Collection
This is a collection of recipes that have been frequently used by the Oranday family.
However, this collection can never be complete and will always be seeing additions to it.
As new recipes come in, new categories will come in with them if they do not fit within the already written categories.


The best way to see what recipes are available would be to view the table of contents in the **recipe.pdf** file.
One could also look in the folders for a list of added recipes in that category.
Recipes that will be added, but that are not yet present in the **recipe.pdf** file, are labeled as WIP for their completion.


Many of the recipes will have **??** for the timing as these have not yet been measured.
These recipes will still be considered complete, and they will (hopefully) be updated when an approximate time is measured.
